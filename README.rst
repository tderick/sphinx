About credit-tests
=====================

**credit-tests** is a Python package that provides a set of statistical tests and tools to assess the performance of the credit risk models. The aim of the package is to provide all common tests used by today's modellers when developing, maintaining and validating their PD, LGD, EAD and prepayment models. All tests have been thoroughly tested and documented. Whenever possible, the definition of the test was retrieved from the authoritive source like EBA, ECB or Basel Committee.

The contributors started built their first statistical models in 2003. Over the years, the same tests have been implemented leading to inefficient usage of resources.

## Main Features
This is the list of main features:

  - tests cover both IFRS 9 and IRB models as well as non-regulatory models
  - the complete lists of tests is available here: [**all tests**][tests]
  - for the purpose of unit testing all tests have been implemented in [**Excel workbook**][tests]
  - the tests have been [**documented**][tests] in detail
  - [**commonly accepted tresholds**][tests] have been provided for convenience puproses
